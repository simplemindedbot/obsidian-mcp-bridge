- **Environment Variable Support**: Store sensitive configuration outside the codebase  
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs and MCP responses are validated
- **Secure Communication**: HTTPS/WSS required for external connections

**For Developers**: See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for comprehensive security guidelines.

### Architecture

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|
| **MCP Client** | Protocol implementation and server management |
| **Bridge Interface** | Obsidian ‚Üî MCP translation layer |
| **Knowledge Engine** | Content discovery and relevance scoring |
| **Note Connection Service** | Multi-type relationship analysis and network mapping |
| **Vault Search Service** | Enhanced vault search with plugin integration |
| **LLM Query Router** | Context-aware query classification and routing |
| **UI Components** | Settings interface and chat view |
| **Testing Suite** | 40+ unit tests with comprehensive coverage |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations 

Current limitations and areas for improvement:

- **Test Suite**: Some MCP client tests have timeout issues in mock scenarios (core functionality works correctly)
- **LLM Routing**: Requires API keys for intelligent routing (falls back to static routing when disabled)
- **Performance**: Large vault analysis may take several seconds (>1000 notes)
- **Visualization**: Network graphs are text-based (visual graphs planned for v0.3.0)

We're actively working on these improvements for future releases.
